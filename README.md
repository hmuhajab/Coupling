# Coupling
The coupling algorithm implementation:
This code to calculate the number of external classes (NEC) and reference to External Classes (REC) 
The coupling metrics for ontology-based systems are represented in OWL: NEC, REC. 
The number of external classes (NEC) is calculated as the number of distinct external classes defined in O. 
The reference to External Classes (REC) is the number of references to external classes in the ontology O.
