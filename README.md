# Coupling
The coupling algorithm implementation:
Three coupling metrics for ontology-based systems are represented in OWL: NEC, REC, and RI. 
The number of external classes (NEC) is calculated as the number of distinct external classes defined in O. 
The reference to External Classes (REC) is the number of references to external classes in the ontology O. 
Referenced includes (RI) is defined as the number of includes at the top of the ontology definition file.
